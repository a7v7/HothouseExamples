# BasicSynth

Contributed by Cleveland Music Co. \<<code@clevelandmusicco.com>\>

## Description

Super basic monophonic synthesizer example with selectable waveforms, Moog-style filter, resonance, attack and decay. Note information read via MIDI over USB, so you will need a USB host. Just flash the example and the Hothouse becomes a simple synth.
