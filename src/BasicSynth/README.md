# BasicSynth

Contributed by Cleveland Music Co. \<<code@clevelandmusicco.com>\>

## Description

Super basic monophonic synthesizer example with multiple waveforms, Moog-style filter, resonance, attack and decay. Note information is read via MIDI over USB, so you will need a USB host (your computer, a [commercial](https://www.google.com/search?q=USB+midi+host) or [DIY solution](https://youtu.be/N4yUduOqR3M?feature=shared)). Just flash the example and the Hothouse becomes a simple synth.
