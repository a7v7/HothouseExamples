# StereoTest

Contributed by Cleveland Music Co. \<<code@clevelandmusicco.com>\>

## Description

A simple but useful utility project that generates a selectable wave type with variable frequency, amplitude, and panning options. I use it to calibrate my listening position while working on stereo effects. No one has a perfect room, and many listening spaces are plagued by phase cancellation, standing waves, and other stereo imaging issues.

This code generates pure tones across the stereo field, so you can identify problem areas in your room where these issues are most prominent. Test different frequencies and waveforms and adjust speaker placement, your position, and room treatment for better stereo imaging.

### Controls
