# HardwareTest

Contributed by Cleveland Music Co. \<<code@clevelandmusicco.com>\>

## Description

Tests the Hothouse hardware by exercising the audio I/O and all knobs, switches, and LEDs. It's basically a tricked out [Devil's Triangle Drone Synth](https://paulinthelab.blogspot.com/2012/10/devils-triangle-drone-synth-stripboard.html) that uses three oscillators with variable frequency and amplitude. Stereo audio input is mixed with the synth output.

> [!TIP]
> This is a handy utility to test a newly-assembled Hothouse. It's what we use to test each pre-assembled pedal before it is shipped out.
